# Abstract

<p align='justify'> The research aims to explain the factors mostly influence residential sector energy demand in Italy. The data is collected from different sources including ISTAT, and EUROSTAT considering six explanatory variables including resident population, purchasing power parities, household size, median household income, residential electricity cost, and the cost of residential natural gas for the period of eleven years from 2009 to 2019. Best subset selection method is applied for the sake of choosing the optimal number of regressors by comparing different criteria including R2, RSS, Mallows’s Cp, AIC, and BIC. After that, an ordinary least squares regression model is implemented on selected independent variables in order to investigate how they can explain household energy consumption in Italy. The research suggest that an increase in resident population density in Italy would in fact lead to a decrease in overall energy consumption. Thus, in order to design more a comprehensive energy plan, and to improve the accuracy of energy consumption forecasts, resident population should be fully considered. Besides, we also find several policy implications that could be introduced to ensure Italy’s energy independence. </p>
